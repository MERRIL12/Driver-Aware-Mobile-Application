# Driver-Aware-Mobile-Application
The mobile application Drive is built to support the IoT device which is used for Drowsinness detection in drivers.
The working of the application could be viewed from "working app video".
The application is built using flutter SDK and dart language. Firebase cloud messaging is used to support the application for sending timely notifications to the users.
The DRIVE application contains a screen which is used for sign in and sign up. Upon successfull login it directs to a home screen which has four buttons: status, maps, ride hours and reccomendations.
Status: It shows the driver when he was drowsy and how he was detected as drowsy. 
Maps: It helps the driver to navigate towards his destination.
Ride Hours: It shows the hours that the driver was on road. Which could be helpful for the driver on understanding on how much rest he should get.
Reccomendations: It points out to the driver on how he could be safer on road to prevents accidents.
Rewarding system is also implemented in the application so that the users would be rewarded on their non drowsy driving. The reward points could be redeemed from amazon hence the app is linked with the same.
